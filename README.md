Hi, I started a new project today. Initially, I decided to make the code only with Python and Random, because today I started to learn Pandas and I want to integrate it into the code!
The code now is very simple: you have an RPG Store, just for study, where you can only buy a sword or a shield, but to implement a new item is very simple, just adding a few lines.
I will in the future add Pandas, like I said, and when I do, the system will have its own spreadsheet to read and understand the costs and the items, making it easier to add new items!
After that, I want to add a system that saves the players too, like a 'bank' that will have the nickname and maybe a password to use an account, and in this way, your gold will be safe!
Additionally, I want to integrate this code in the future with HTML to make something like a website. It will be something simple, because I can't pay for hosting for the site, so it will be more like a portfolio than a real shop.
